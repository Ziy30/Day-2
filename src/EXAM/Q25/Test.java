/*
 * At Line n1, an int [] object of three elements is created and 'arr' refers to
 * this array object.
 * 
 * arr[0] = 10, arr[1] = 20 and arr[2] = 30;
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Given expression at Line n2:
 * 
 * arr[i++] = arr[++i] = 40;
 * 
 * Multiple assignment operators are available, so lets group it first.
 * 
 * => arr[i++] = (arr[++i] = 40); //Assignment operator is right to left
 * associative
 * 
 * Above expression is valid, hence Line n2 compiles successfully.
 * 
 * Let's solve the expression now. Left operand is 'arr[i++]' and right operand
 * is '(arr[++i] = 40)'. Left operand is evaluated first.
 * 
 * => arr[0] = (arr[++i] = 40); //i = 1
 * 
 * Right hand operand is evaluated next.
 * 
 * => arr[0] = (arr[2] = 40); //i = 2
 * 
 * => arr[0] = 40; //i = 2, arr[2] = 40.
 * 
 * Hence after Line n2, arr refers to int [] object {40, 20, 40}.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Given loop prints below on to the console:
 * 
 * 40
 * 
 * 20
 * 
 * 40
