/*
 * For the 1st loop variable 'i' infers to int type, so no issues for 1st loop
 * and for the 2nd loop variable 'j' infers to int type, so no issues for 2nd
 * loop as well.
 * 
 * Let's check the iteration:
 * 
 * 1st iteration of loop one: i = 0
 * 
 * 1st iteration of loop two: j = 0
 * 
 * 1st iteration of loop three: ctr = 101. As `i == j` evaluates to true, hence
 * `break two;` gets executed, which takes the control out of loop two and hence
 * to the increment expression (i++) of loop one.
 * 
 * 2nd iteration of loop one; i = 1
 * 
 * 1st iteration of loop two: j = 0
 * 
 * 1st iteration of loop three; ctr = 102. As `i > j` evaluates to true, hence
 * `break one;` gets executed, which takes the control out of the loop one.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * `System.out.println(ctr);` prints 102 on to the console.
