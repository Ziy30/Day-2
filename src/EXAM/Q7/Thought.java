/*
 * Let's check all the given options one by one:
 * 
 *--> public void static main(String [] args): 
    Compilation error as return type'void' must come just before the method name 'main'.
 * 
 * --> protected static void main(String [] args): 
   Compiles successfully but as this method is not public, hence an Error regarding missing main method is thrown
    on execution.
 * 
 * --> public void main(String... args): 
 * Compiles successfully but as this method is not static, 
   hence an Error regarding non-static main method is thrown on
   execution.
 * 
 * --> static public void Main(String [] args): 
 * Compiles successfully but as 'M' is capital in method 'Main', 
   hence it is not special main method. An Error
   regarding missing main method is thrown on execution.
 * 
 * --> static public void main(String [] args): Valid definition, it compiles
 * successfully and on execution prints "All is well" on to the console.
 * 
 * --> public static void main(String [] a): Valid definition, it compiles
 * successfully and on execution prints "All is well" on to the console.
 * 
 * --> public static Void main(String [] args): Compilation error as Void is a final
 * class in Java and in this case compiler expects main method to return a value
 * of Void type. If you add `return null;` to the main method code will compile
 * successfully but on execution an Error will be thrown mentioning that return
 * type must be 'void' ('v' in lower-case).
 * 
 * --> public static void main(String... a): Valid definition, it compiles
 * successfully and on execution prints "All is well" on to the console.
