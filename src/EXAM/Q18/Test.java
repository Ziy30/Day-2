 * Given boolean expression:

 * (num++ == num++) //num=10
 * 
 * (10 == num++) //Left side operand is evaluated first, value 10 is used in the
 * expression and variable num is incremented by 1, so num=11
 * 
 * (10 == 11) //Right side operand is evaluated next, value 11 is used in the
 * expression and variable num is incremented by 1, so num = 12
 * 
 * Above expression evaluates to false, hence else block is executed and NOT
 * EQUAL 12 is printed on to the console.
