/*
 * As instance variables are hidden by subclasses and not overridden, therefore
 * instance variable can be accessed by using explicit casting.
 * 
 * Let's check all the options one by one:
 * 
 * gc.quote => It refers to "PLAY PLAY PLAY" as gc is of GrandChild class.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * (Parent)gc.quote => gc.quote will be evaluated first as dot (.) operator has
 * higher precedence than cast. gc.quote refers to String, hence it cannot be
 * casted to Parent type. This would cause compilation error.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ((Parent)gc).quote => Variable 'gc' is casted to Parent type, so this
 * expression refers to "MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES". It is one of the correct
 * options.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * ((Parent)(Child)gc).quote => 'gc' is of GrandChild type, it is first casted
 * to Child and then to Parent type and finally quote variable is accessed, so
 * this expression refers to "MONEY DOESN'T GROW ON TREES". It is also one of
 * the correct options.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * (Parent)(Child)gc.quote => gc.quote will be evaluated first as dot (.)
 * operator has higher precedence than cast. gc.quote refers to String, hence it
 * cannot be casted to Child type. This would cause compilation error.
