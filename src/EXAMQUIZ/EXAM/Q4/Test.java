/*

 * 
 * append(...) method in StringBuilder class is overloaded to accept various
 * arguments and 2 such arguments are String and CharSequence. It's return type
 * is StringBuilder and as StringBuilder class implements CharSequence
 * interface, hence 'sb.append("A")' can easily be passed as and argument to
 * sb.append(...) method. Line n2 compiles successfully.
 * 
 * At Line n2:
 * 
 * sb.append(sb.append("A")); //sb --> {"B"}
 * 
 * sb.append({"BA"}); //sb --> {"BA"}
 * 
 * {"BABA"}
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Hence, Line n3 prints BABA
